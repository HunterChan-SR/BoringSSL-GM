# BoringSSL-GM

**BoringSSL-GM** 是基于 [Google BoringSSL](https://github.com/google/boringssl) **0.20240913.0** 版本的扩展实现，增加了对中国国家密码算法（SM 系列）的支持，包括：

* **SM2**（椭圆曲线公钥加密与签名算法 未实现）
* **SM3**（哈希算法）
* **SM4**（对称分组加密算法 未实现）

该项目旨在为需要国密支持的安全通信协议（如 SSL/TLS、PSI、SCQL 等）提供与 BoringSSL 保持兼容的替代实现。

# BoringSSL

BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL that is designed to meet Google's needs.

Although BoringSSL is an open source project, it is not intended for general
use, as OpenSSL is. We don't recommend that third parties depend upon it. Doing
so is likely to be frustrating because there are no guarantees of API or ABI
stability.

Programs ship their own copies of BoringSSL when they use it and we update
everything as needed when deciding to make API changes. This allows us to
mostly avoid compromises in the name of compatibility. It works for us, but it
may not work for you.

BoringSSL arose because Google used OpenSSL for many years in various ways and,
over time, built up a large number of patches that were maintained while
tracking upstream OpenSSL. As Google's product portfolio became more complex,
more copies of OpenSSL sprung up and the effort involved in maintaining all
these patches in multiple places was growing steadily.

Currently BoringSSL is the SSL library in Chrome/Chromium, Android (but it's
not part of the NDK) and a number of other apps/programs.
